# Scorekeeper2

Scorekeeper2 uses a Crazy Circuits Invention Board to keep score for a game that has multiple point values that can be triggered via closing circuits.

You can use buttons or build your own switches using Maker Tape and cardboard, LEGO, or whatever materials you desire.

By default the code allows for 5 switches, and uses point values of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 25 points. (You can change them to anything you like.)

The code also has a desired score you need to reach. We set it to 300 but you can change that as well.

The Arduino sketch `Scorekeeper2` can be found in the **Arduino** folder.

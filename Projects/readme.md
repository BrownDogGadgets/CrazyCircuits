This is a simple dumping ground for code as well as projects we're working on. 

This is not intended for Step by Step directions, nor as a place you should be going to for full build guides. For that you should check out all our finished projects on BrownDogGadgets.com.

Seriously, this is just an area with raw project files. Go to our website and get details, pictures, guides, and videos.

# All Pins Fade

This code makes all pins randomly fade on pretty much any Arudino board. Both digital and analogue. This is handy for wearable and simple lighting projects where you need lots of randomly twinkling LEDs. We've used it for a ball gown that was space themed, as well as for a LEGO disco floor.  

The code uses the MsTimer2 Library which can easily be downloaded through the Arduino IDE.

The code is pretty simple, you can define the number of LEDs as well as the max fade points of the LEDs.

The code was originally written by Osamu Iwasaki who was nice enough to share it with us for a project year ago.

# Arduino Maze

This project uses the Crazy Circuits Robotics Board to activate a servo in a LEGO maze.

Overall this is a very simple project. We're using two pieces of Maker Tape conductive tape to act as our switch and then using a metal ball bearing to activitive the switch, which in turn activates the servo.

To add some extra fun to the activity we also added in a Piezo Speaker as a count down timer.

In the example picture we're using a LEGO friendly Geek Servo, through there are many different DIY LEGO Adaptors that can be laser cut and 3D printed for a standard 9G servo.

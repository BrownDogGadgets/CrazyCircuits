# Status Light

This is a simple two Touch Point sketch that activates two LEDs.  We're using this as a "Status Light" for our Photography Room.

One LED is always on in this sketch.  

Touch the "On" Touch Point to make a set of LEDs Fade in and Out.

Touch the "Off" Touch Point to make the second set of LEDs turn On.  This set does not Fade.

This was you can have a "Room In Use" set of LEDs that Fade to let people know they shouldn't enter.  

We're using Bare Conductive Paint for our two wall Touch Points, and using Conductive Tape to connect everything.

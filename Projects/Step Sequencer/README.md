# Step Sequencer

![](Images/step-sequencer.jpg)

A Step Sequencer built with Crazy Circuits parts on a LEGO baseplate. You can experiment with making your own beats using the four step audio sequencer. Set the frequency for each of the four notes and control the speed with the tempo potentiometer. The LEDs will light up to correspond with the note being played.
